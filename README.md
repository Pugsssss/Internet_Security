Now find definitions for
  * Advanced Persistent Threat -  a network attack in which an unauthorized person gains access to a network and stays there undetected for a long period of time. The intention of an APT attack is to steal data rather than to cause damage to the network or organization.
  
  * backdoor - A technique in which a system security mechanism is bypassed undetectably to access a computer or its data. The backdoor access method is sometimes written by the programmer who develops a program.
  
  * botnet - A botnet is a collection of compromised computers often referred to as "zombies" infected with malware that allows an attacker to control them.
  
  * brute force - Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies.
  
  * exploit - A general term for any method used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to computers, the act itself of a hacking attack, or a hole in a system's security that opens a system to an attack.
  
  * key logger - a type of surveillance software (considered to be either software or spyware) that has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log file, usually encrypted. A keylogger recorder can record instant messages, e-mail, and any information you type at any time using your keyboard.
  
  * logic bomb - a set of instructions secretly incorporated into a program so that if a particular condition is satisfied they will be carried out, usually with harmful effects.
  
  * Macro virus - a computer virus that "infects" a Microsoft Word or similar application and causes a sequence of actions to be performed automatically when the application is started or something else triggers it. Macro viruses tend to be surprising but relatively harmless.
  
  * port scan - The act of systematically scanning a computer's ports. Since a port is a place where information goes into and out of a computer, port scanning identifies open doors to a computer. The scanner attempts to connect to all 65,535 ports. strobe: a more focused scan looking only for known services to exploit.
  
  *tabjacking - exploiting a feature found in the latest internet browsers, including Microsoft’s new version of Internet Explorer, IE7, and the rival open source browser Firefox. Both programs let users open several web pages within a single browser window and switch between them quickly by clicking on the tabs at the top of the window.
  
  * ransomware - a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
  
  * rootkit - a type of software designed to hide the fact that an operating system has been compromised, sometimes by replacing vital executables. Rootkits allow viruses and malware to “hide in plain sight” by disguising as necessary files that your antivirus software will overlook.
  
  * worm - Worm has two widely different definitions. One refers to a computer virus and the other is an optical storage technology.
  
  * zero day - deriving from or relating to a previously unknown vulnerability to attack in some software.
  
  * zombie - a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse program and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.
